                    We believe that dance first and foremost should be fun and inspiring. This emphasis is useful whether one is pursuing a professional career in dance, or trying to fulfill a lifetime dream of expressing oneself through movement. The road to achieve this can be exhilarating, mysterious, and difficult, yet extremely fulfilling.

                    Our view is that we as teachers need to establish an atmosphere where anything is possible and the joy of dancing is always encouraged. However, a sound understanding of correct technique, style, musicality, and artistry should be used as the core tools to establish a fundamentally well-rounded dancer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To this intent, we have brought together a group of diverse teachers from a number of different dance disciplines, which share the same basic ideas.  They bring not only the highest technical and artistic standards, but also a current knowledge of all that it takes to "make it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    From our unique perspective as successful well-balanced dancers, teachers, choreographers, and company directors, comes a wealth of experience and love of dance we hope to share with all our students.
